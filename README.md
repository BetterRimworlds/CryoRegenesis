# CryoRegenesis: Forever Young

![CryoRegenesis: Live forever!](https://github.com/BetterRimworlds/CryoRegenesis/blob/master/About/Preview.png?raw=true)

With this Glittertech, all of your colonists (and pets, and even enemies, if you're so 
inclined!) can live forever young!

CryoRegenesis sarcophagi not only restore your pawns to their youthful vigor, they also 
cure all age-related infirmities as well as every physical injury!

 • No more aging. Everyone can be in their 20s!  
 • Heals bad backs, permanent scars, even dimensia, Alzheimer's and bullets to the brain!  
 • Heals most diseases. There is no more need to die from the flu!  
 • Luciferium need cannot be cured, nor can psychological addictions, though physical
   tolerances will disappear.  

Stock up on Uranium. You'll need a whole lot of it!
